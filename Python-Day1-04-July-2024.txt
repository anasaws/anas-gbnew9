		Composite Data types

A composite data type in Python is a type that can hold multiple values of different types within a single structure, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. These types allow for complex data organization and manipulation.

Real Life example:


	Ticket Booking App

	Movie = Name, Year, Flag

	Movie = "Name"	-> String
	Movie = 1999	-> Int
	Movie = True 	-> Bool



Collection in Python

Array : 

Array are used to store multiple values in single variable.
		m_array = ["hello", "Ford"]
		print(m_array[1])		# Call value by index

Index Value: 

Index value refers to the position of an element within a sequence (such as a list, string, or tuple). Indexing allows you to access individual elements based on their position. Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first element of a sequence has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.


List: 

A list in Python is an ordered collection of items that can hold a variety of data types. 
Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed. Lists are defined using square brackets [], and items within the list are separated by commas.
 
	
	Example:	mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
			print(mixed_list)
